<!--(Temporary Text)Hey I'm Paul! Yes I know about the goofy monkey... Though we're not here to talk about that. We're here to talk about food and a little about me I guess. I don't 
                have any professional experience nor did I go to school for it, but I feel like I'm at least a good home cook. I had to learn how to cook when I was younger because my mom wasn't 
                really into cooking and I wanted something other than pb&js. I really like to bake deserts and have gotten pretty good at cooking things that I enjoy to eat. I'm also Italian
                so my dad has taught me how to make some really tasty Italian classics. Thanks for checking out my recipes. I've spent half my life working on them and am most likely going
                to be editing them as I improve them in the future.-->

            <p class="about">About Me:</p>   
            <p class="aboutt">Hey I'm Paul, and welcome to my website! This website is meant for me, my friends, and family 
                to go on here and look up any recipes that we enjoy. Its also meant as practice for me in making websites in 
                general. We are hopefully going to have a lot of different people's recipes in here. My background in cooking 
                is me just being a homecook. I had to teach myself when I was much younger because circomstances just sorta worked 
                out that way. I ended up really enjoying it and luckily my dad is an amazing cook and I got to learn a lot from him 
                when I was younger. Now a days my sister and I are the cooks in the house and we share responsibilites when it comes 
                to cooking for big events and what not. We both love cooking and luckily have very different tastes when it comes to 
                cooking so we sorta balance each other out. What you'll see on here from me specifically is a lot of baking, Italian 
                food, and anything else I've learned over the years. The theme of this website is based off of a cookbook that I made 
                for someone special a while back. Thanks for visiting and I hope you find a good recipe in here somewhere.
