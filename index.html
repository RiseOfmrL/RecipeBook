            <p class="aboutt">Hey I'm Paul! Yes I know about the goofy monkey... Though we're not here to talk about that. We're here to talk about food and a little about me I guess. I don't 
                have any professional experience nor did I go to school for it, but I feel like I'm at least a good home cook. I had to learn how to cook when I was younger because my mom wasn't 
                really into cooking and I wanted something other than pb&js. I really like to bake deserts and have gotten pretty good at cooking things that I enjoy to eat. I'm also Italian
                so my dad has taught me how to make some really tasty Italian classics. Thanks for checking out my recipes. I've spent half my life working on them and am most likely going
                to be editing them as I improve them in the future.
