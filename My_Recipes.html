        <!--So how I want to programs this is one of two ways. One way is to have all of the recipes already written out and have them
        hidden with css. There will be a selector that chooses one of the recipes and reveals it. That way I have the majority
        of the programming done in the htnml and css with a minimal amount done in java. The other way would be to have almost
        none of the programming done in html and css and have empty sections on them with the selector still that changes the
        text and pictures of the emtpy sections to what you select. That way I can get more practice with java. I think the
        second one will take longer and I'm not sure how to do the linking thing easily for the first page.-->


        <!-- So I decided that I'm going to use the display:none command in css. That will change the formatting on things so I'm able
        to have the recipe that people select on the top while the rest is nonexistant. and I'll be able to figure out how to
        link it to a certain part of the page if I keep it so on the first screen it shows all of the recipes on there. That way I
        can make a table of contents/have links on the main page to more easily get access to everything.-->

            <p class="RecipeDescription">This is my favorite pancake and waffle batter. Ive found that you're able to
                use this same recipe for either pancakes or waffles. My favorite way to enjoy this is with some blueberries in the
                batter. They are perfect for breakfast and generally pretty quick to make. If you make the waffles you can also
                enjoy them with some fried chicken to have with your waffles.

                        <ol class="instructionsList">

                            <li>First take out 2 bowls,one large and one medium. In the medium sized bowl put in your dry
                                ingredients (flour,baking soda, salt, sugar). Then whisk them until combined. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Second do the same with the wet ingredients (Buttermilk,Melted Butter, Eggs, and Vanilla).
                                And then mix them all thoroughly.
                            </li>
                            <li>Pour all of the dry ingredients into your wet ingredients and whisk together lightly until
                                all the flour is mixed in. You want it to be mixed, but make sure not to mix too much.
                                Remember that lumps are ok. Mixing less gives you fluffier pancakes or waffles.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you're making waffles, I'd use some pam or something simular to grease up the 
                                waffle iron so there isn't sticking. Then simply pour the batter in evenly. Also most
                                waffle irons have a timer set up, but if it doesn't then I suggest to cook it for around
                                3-5 minutes. A trick is to wait for it to stop steaming though you can do it slighly
                                earlier if you like less done waffles.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you're making pancakes I'd start by heating up and greasing the griddle or pan that
                                you're using to a low-medium heat. I'd recommend using a 1/4 cup to pour your pancakes
                                so they are all around the same size. After you pour them in don't touch the pancakes
                                until you see the sides start to pull in and solidify and you see bubbles start to form in
                                the middle of the pancake. Then flip them and wait for about a minute or two or until both
                                sides are golden brown. Flip more if needed.

                from time to time when I need it. It works better than regular milk, but only almost as good as 
                buttermilk in recipes that need buttermilk. Still a really good and really easy way to get buttermilk
                fast if you need it.

                                <li>Firstly you have to start off with some bread. I recommend a thicker slice as opposed
                                    to a smaller one as they tend to have a better texture and I have always enjoyed more.
                                    One time I always like to make french toast is the day after I make an oatmeal loaf
                                    as that always makes a really good french toast.
                                </li>
                                <li>So right after you cut up your bread then you should grab a bowl that's big 
                                    enough to have your bread lay flat in it. In that bowl you should break your eggs.
                                </li>
                                <li>After breaking your eggs you then need to add in your other ingredients(Milk,
                                    a good amount of cinnamon, and your vanilla) and then whisk it all together.
                                </li>
                                <li>Then I'd grab whatever pan I'm planning to use, any is fine as long as it can fit
                                    your bread in it, and start either cooking up a slice or two of bacon or using a
                                    a different fat like butter, crisco, or something simular.
                                </li>

                                <li>Then when your pan is heated up with whatever fat you're using you dip your
                                    toast into your egg mixture for a couple seconds on both sides (making sure to cover
                                    every inch of it with thte mixture). Then carefully put your toast into the pan.
                                </li>
                                <li>Cook your pan on low-medium heat for a few minutes on both sides or until golden
                                    brown and you're all set.

                                <li>In a small bowl combine the eggs, milk and honey.</li>
                                <li>If you want to use a stand mixer than in the bowl that goes with that you 
                                    should put in your flour, yeast, and salt into the bowl. Then using the paddle 
                                    attachment(if you have it) start to mix together those dry ingredients.
                                </li>
                                <li>Then slowly add in your butter one piece at a time until you've added all of them.
                                    When its all incorporated and the dough is formed. Then grease a large bowl to 
                                    let the dough rest in for 30ish minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or something 
                                    simular.
                                </li>

                                <li>If you don't have the paddle attachment and prefer to do it by hand that works 
                                    perfectly well too. In fact You can do the same thing with a spoon. Once you've 
                                    incorperated everything together with the spoon. Then you should kneed the dough until
                                    its incorporated and a little smooth. I recommend kneeding for about 5-10 minutes.
                                    Just like the other steps you need to let it rest for 30 minutes.
                                </li>
                                <li>After the 30 minutes then try to fold the dough over itself. After doing that a 
                                    few times cover the dough again and let rise. Repeat this process a couple more times 
                                    for a couple hours. 
                                </li>
                                <li>After the couple hours then let rest in the fridge overnight. Though make 
                                    sure that the bowl is securely covered with plastic wrap or something simular.
                                </li>

                                <li>The next day take the dough out and kneed it cold for around a minute or two.
                                    Then shape it into a ball and cover it with flour and let it come to room temp.
                                </li>
                                <li>While its going to room temp mix together all the ingredients for the filling 
                                    ; brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and melted butter in a small bowl.
                                </li>

                                <li>Then , using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 16/12 ince rectangle. 
                                    Using your filling mixture brush it evenly onto the dough making sure to cover it 
                                    completely. Then starting at the long side start to hand roll it into a log or 
                                    cylindrical shape. Then punch the seam gently to seal it. 
                                </li>

                                <li> Then having the dough seal side down start to cut the log into around 12 or so 
                                    equal pieces using a sharp knife. Then when you're done move the pieces to 
                                    a greesed pan and place them cut side up. Then cover with plastic wrap and let rise 
                                    for about an hour. This rise determines the size of the rolls that you get so you can 
                                    stop it in about a half hour instead if you want smaller rolls.
                                </li>

                                <li>After the last resting time then preheat your oven to 350F or 180C and (after 
                                    removing the platic) putting the rolls into the oven for 27-32 minutes. *Another thing 
                                    that's optional to do before putting them in the oven is to put a little cream or 
                                    milk in with the cinnamon rolls before you cook. It can make them even more moist 
                                    and delicious, but is totally optional.
                                </li>
                                <li>While its baking Then you'd make your frosting by combining all of the 
                                    frosting ingredients together and stirring until smooth and nice looking.
                                </li>
                                <li>When you're done baking then let them rest for about 5 minutes, add the frosting, 
                                    and then you're done. Eat up and enjoy your sweet treat.
                                </li>

                                        <li>First you need to heat your milk to a simmer on your stovetop. While 
                                            this is going on add your oats and butter into a medium bowl or in a 
                                            stand mixer and mix it together and add in your milk by pouring it on top. 
                                            After it's combined set the mixture aside for about 30 minutes to an hour, 
                                            or until the mixture is room temperature.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>After the mixture is at room temperature then add in your honey, warm water, 
                                            yeast, and salt. Stir until combined and add the Bread Flour. After the 
                                            Bread Flour is added in and combined with everything slowly add in your
                                            All-Purpose Flour until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the 
                                            bowl. Make sure to not add too much flour, you want the dough to be soft 
                                            and a little sticky. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Kneed the dough for a few minutes until smooth and elastic and make sure to
                                            scrape the sides of the bowl to get all the dough.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Transfer the dough to a greased bowl and cover the bowl with a dish towl or 
                                            plastic wrap until it is doubled in size, or about an hour.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>When you feel the dough is about doubled in size then take the dough and 
                                            punch it so it deflates. Then cut the dough into two loaf shaped balls. Then
                                            put the two loafs into two seaparate greased loaf pans so the dough doesn't stick 
                                            too much. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Then you'd want to make some quick egg wash. To make the egg wash what you'd 
                                            have to do is beat an egg into 1 tablespoon of cold water. When you feel it is mixed thoroughly
                                            then brush it onto the two loaves.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Then sprinkle some of the oats on the top to make the topping look nice and and for some texture. 
                                            Cover it with plastic wrap and let sit for about 30-45 minutes. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Then take the plastic wrap off and preheat the oven to 350F/175C and bake for about 30-40 minutes. 
                                            When its golden brown sometime within that time then you're all set. Let it cool down for 20 minutes 
                                            and then take them out of the pans. Then let it cool down the rest of the way on a cooling rack for a 
                                            while. If you're planning on leaving it out for a while cover it with a towel to preserve it a little.

                                for actual generations. When my dad was growing up she used to bake these rolls with dinner 
                                and they were a family favorite. My great grandmother was never good about writing the 
                                whole recipe down so my aunt has been working on recreating the recipe for years now. A 
                                year or two ago I finally got her to share the recipe with me. Now I want to share it with 
                                all of my friends and the rest of my family and whoever else finds it.

                                            <li>So first you want to heat up your milk in a saucepan and scald it. Stir 
                                                frequently and take it off the heat when you start to see any bubbles 
                                                forming. Take a half cup of the hot milk out and put it aside in a separate 
                                                bowl to cool down. While that milk is cooling down till lukewarm get a large 
                                                bowl and put the rest of the milk, shortening, sugar, and salt in it.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>When the milk is lukewarm then add in the yeast to it and slowly stir until 
                                                combined. Add 2 Cups of Flour and the yeast mixture and let rise until 
                                                there is bubbles. Add flour until the dough can be handled (about 4 cups) and 
                                                knead the dough until its elastic. Let the dough rise until about tripled in 
                                                size.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Knead the dough again and then place it on a floured surface and start to 
                                                cut the dough into little pieces and shape them into circles about the size 
                                                of large marbles.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Brush the dough with butter and stick 3 of the dough pieces together. I suggest 
                                                using a muffin tin to make it so they all stick together. If you're going for a 
                                                plain roll then I suggest just brushing a little butter on it put them in the oven 
                                                at 425F/215C for 15-20 minutes. If you want a topping then look at the next 
                                                step for how to do that.(make sure you do that before you put them in the oven.)
                                            </li>
                                            <li>If you want a topping on them I suggest a pecan topping. It's the preferred 
                                                topping for our family for a reason. If you're planning on adding the topping 
                                                you start off by crushing up some pecans and melting up your 4 tablespoons of 
                                                butter. Then you mix that butter with your 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Then you can add

                                                them or after 5 minutes in.

            <p class="RecipeDescription">This is a take on my sister Nicole's Brown Butter Chocolate Chip cookies that 
                I did a couple times for desert on a family dinner night. Instead of a whole bunch of cookies I made 
                one giant one in my cast iron skillet. It's totally worth it if you have one and are having a party or 
                a family dinner. It's an easy desert that's fun and very tasty.

                <p class="RecipeDescription">This is a recipe that I learned from my Dad. I've 
                    worked on it over the years and feel I've made a few adjustments and made it 
                    my own. It's a simple, but time consuming recipe that you sort of keep simmering 
                    in the background while you're cooking other things. You definately want this 
                    to cook for a while so keep that in mind. This version will be very versitile so that you 
                    can use it on anything that you like marinara sauce on. From pizza to pasta it should work 
                    for what you want. Also you should be using this as more of a base than like a final end all 
                    be all sauce. Marinara is really done to someone's liking and you can edit it as you see fit. 
                    You can make it spicy, or add some alcohol, or add different vegetables if you'd like.

                                <li>First you want to start off with the holy trinity of tomato sauce. Start by 
                                    very thinly cutting up your celery and carrots. I suggest to keep your onions 
                                    a little thicker because I like onions but that's up to you. After you've prepped 
                                    those then stick them in a large pot with some olive oil on a low-medium heat for 
                                    10-15 minutes stirring occasionally. After that add in some minced up garlic and let 
                                    that simmer for about 5-10 minutes. (If you want to add in some other veggies then this 
                                    would be the time for that. Other veggies that I'd suggest adding is mushrooms, zucchini, 
                                    and maybe some roasted garlic.)
                                </li>
                                <li>Once you got your vegetables simmered then you should open up your cans of tomatoes, 
                                    whether it be the San Marizanos or another type, and pour them into the large pot. From 
                                    here on out I'd say a lot of the messurements are more optional rather than required. Though 
                                    I think I set a good benchmark of what would work in a sauce.
                                </li>
                                <li>Once you've simmered your tomatoes you should start trying to crush them with either 
                                    a spoon or a pulverizer or something depending on how chunky you like yoru sauce. Then 
                                    crush each tomato till you have a bit less chunks.
                                </li>
                                <li>Now you should start adding in some of the other ingredients to slowly change the 
                                    taste to how you like. I suggest adding in the rosemary, oregano, and the bay leaf early on to add that 
                                    flavor into your sauce and really incorporate them. 
                                </li>
                                <li>After a few minutes then you should add in the rest of your Worcestershire and Soy 
                                    Sauce, Dijon mustard, and your sugar. Of course add in salt and black pepper to taste 
                                    as well. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Now you'll want to have the sauce simmer on really low and taste it occasionally over 
                                    the time that you're cooking it to add more ingredients if necessary. This might be 
                                    hard the first time that you're doing this, but will for sure get easier and easier every 
                                    time you make the recipe.
                                </li>
                                <li>You'll want to cook this for around 2-4 hours on a low heat and have it slowly incorperate 
                                    all of the flavors you're adding.
                                </li>
                                <li>When it's all done then make sure to take out the bay leaf and then you'll be able to use 
                                    it on whatever you want to use your new very tastey sauce on.
                                </li>
