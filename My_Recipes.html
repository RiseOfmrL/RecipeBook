        <!--So how I want to programs this is one of two ways. One way is to have all of the recipes already written out and have them
        hidden with css. There will be a selector that chooses one of the recipes and reveals it. That way I have the majority
        of the programming done in the htnml and css with a minimal amount done in java. The other way would be to have almost
        none of the programming done in html and css and have empty sections on them with the selector still that changes the
        text and pictures of the emtpy sections to what you select. That way I can get more practice with java. I think the
        second one will take longer and I'm not sure how to do the linking thing easily for the first page.-->
