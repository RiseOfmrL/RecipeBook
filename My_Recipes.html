        <!--So how I want to programs this is one of two ways. One way is to have all of the recipes already written out and have them
        hidden with css. There will be a selector that chooses one of the recipes and reveals it. That way I have the majority
        of the programming done in the htnml and css with a minimal amount done in java. The other way would be to have almost
        none of the programming done in html and css and have empty sections on them with the selector still that changes the
        text and pictures of the emtpy sections to what you select. That way I can get more practice with java. I think the
        second one will take longer and I'm not sure how to do the linking thing easily for the first page.-->


        <!-- So I decided that I'm going to use the display:none command in css. That will change the formatting on things so I'm able
        to have the recipe that people select on the top while the rest is nonexistant. and I'll be able to figure out how to
        link it to a certain part of the page if I keep it so on the first screen it shows all of the recipes on there. That way I
        can make a table of contents/have links on the main page to more easily get access to everything.-->

                use this same recipe for either pancakes or waffles. My favorite way to enjoy this is with some blueberries in the
                batter. They are perfect for breakfast and generally pretty quick to make. If you make the waffles you can also
                enjoy them with some fried chicken to have with your waffles.

                        <ol class="instructionsList">

                            <li>First take out 2 bowls,one large and one medium. In the medium sized bowl put in your dry
                                ingredients (flour,baking soda, salt, sugar). Then whisk them until combined. 
                            </li>
                            <li>Second do the same with the wet ingredients (Buttermilk,Melted Butter, Eggs, and Vanilla).
                                And then mix them all thoroughly.
                            </li>
                            <li>Pour all of the dry ingredients into your wet ingredients and whisk together lightly until
                                all the flour is mixed in. You want it to be mixed, but make sure not to mix too much.
                                Remember that lumps are ok. Mixing less gives you fluffier pancakes or waffles.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you're making waffles, I'd use some pam or something simular to grease up the 
                                waffle iron so there isn't sticking. Then simply pour the batter in evenly. Also most
                                waffle irons have a timer set up, but if it doesn't then I suggest to cook it for around
                                3-5 minutes. A trick is to wait for it to stop steaming though you can do it slighly
                                earlier if you like less done waffles.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you're making pancakes I'd start by heating up and greasing the griddle or pan that
                                you're using to a low-medium heat. I'd recommend using a 1/4 cup to pour your pancakes
                                so they are all around the same size. After you pour them in don't touch the pancakes
                                until you see the sides start to pull in and solidify and you see bubbles start to form in
                                the middle of the pancake. Then flip them and wait for about a minute or two or until both
                                sides are golden brown. Flip more if needed.

                from time to time when I need it. It works better than regular milk, but only almost as good as 
                buttermilk in recipes that need buttermilk. Still a really good and really easy way to get buttermilk
                fast if you need it.

                                <li>Firstly you have to start off with some bread. I recommend a thicker slice as opposed
                                    to a smaller one as they tend to have a better texture and I have always enjoyed more.
                                    One time I always like to make french toast is the day after I make an oatmeal loaf
                                    as that always makes a really good french toast.
                                </li>
                                <li>So right after you cut up your bread then you should grab a bowl that's big 
                                    enough to have your bread lay flat in it. In that bowl you should break your eggs.
                                </li>
                                <li>After breaking your eggs you then need to add in your other ingredients(Milk,
                                    a good amount of cinnamon, and your vanilla) and then whisk it all together.
                                </li>
                                <li>Then I'd grab whatever pan I'm planning to use, any is fine as long as it can fit
                                    your bread in it, and start either cooking up a slice or two of bacon or using a
                                    a different fat like butter, crisco, or something simular.
                                </li>

                                <li>Then when your pan is heated up with whatever fat you're using you dip your
                                    toast into your egg mixture for a couple seconds on both sides (making sure to cover
                                    every inch of it with thte mixture). Then carefully put your toast into the pan.
                                </li>
                                <li>Cook your pan on low-medium heat for a few minutes on both sides or until golden
                                    brown and you're all set.
                                </li>

                <p class="RecipeDescription">This is a recipe that I hold close to my heart. Its something that 
                    I make specially for my mom on her special days. Especially Christmas or sometimes on mother's day.
                    I've taken a long time to get this recipe right and so I wanted to share it with all of you so you 
                    can enjoy it too.
